# ECSE420 Parallel-Computing

Parallel Computing coursework at McGill University. Parallelization is implemented by GPUs using CUDA. Code is written either in C (using the Numba package to interface with CUDA).

## Lab 0 - Image processing
Image processing by Rectification and Max Pooling

## Lab 1 - Logic gate simulation

## Lab 2 - Signal processing and for a musical instrument simulation

## Lab 3 - Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## Project - Quantum Fourier Transform
We implemented the Quantum Fourier Transform and analyzied its running time and and verified its correctness
